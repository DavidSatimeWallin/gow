# GOW - a Go Wiki

GOW is a local wiki software built to easily structure local notes, links and general knowledge. It uses a JSON-based file-structure to store the data. The files are encrypted though so the JSON format isnt very useful outside of this software.

If you *double click* on any word or text string you get the choice to create a new articled with that title. Any text that matches an existing articles title will automatically get linked.

In the top there's a search area which uses a ranked fuzzy search. It will rank the content for you and show you a list of hits ranked on importance to you.
